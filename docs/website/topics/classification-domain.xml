  <shortdesc>The classification domain provides metadata specifically for classifying topics or maps, typically in terms of a specific taxonomy.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>The classification domain defines the metadata element <xmlelem>classification</xmlelem>, which is intended to hold metadata that serves to classify a topic or map in terms of one or more taxonomies. It's primary purpose is simply to provide a clear and convenient place to hold classification metadata or to enable the definition of more precise content models for classifying metadata such that the document type rules can require specific metadata elements.</p>
