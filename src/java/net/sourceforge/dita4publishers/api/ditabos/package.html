<p>Extends the base BOS model to accommodate DITA-specific bounded object
sets. Adds types and methods that reflect the abstract DITA data model 
(maps, topics, etc.).
</p>
<p>
Because DITA's map mechanism is specifically about defining collections
of resources via sets of links, it follows that all DITA bounded object sets
are determined either by literal maps or, having been established in some
non-map-based way, can be expressed as maps.</p>
<p>The DITA-specific BOS objects add knowledge of the specific DITA resource
types of map and topic as well as a DITA bounded object set that always
has a root map member.</p>
<p>Note that a DITA bounded object set does not reflect the <i>navigation</i>
hierarchy of the maps, only the map-to-map hierarchy. In addition, BOS members
represent <i>storage objects</i>, not topic elements. Thus, there may be a
significant difference between the logical structure of topics as represented
by the navigation hierarchy in a map and the storage-object-to-storage-object
relationships implicit in the links contained by maps and topics. In addition,
because there is no link-based mechanism for one topic to point to another
topic as a <i>child</i>, topic BOS members never have children, only
dependencies.</p>
