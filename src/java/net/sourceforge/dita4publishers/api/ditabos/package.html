Defines APIs for representing and processing DITA "bounded object sets" (BOS).
A bounded object set is the finite set of resources (store objects, e.g., files) 
ultimately used from some
starting resource (e.g., a root map in a DITA context) or specified in some
other way (e.g., a manually constructed list of maps and topics and related
objects). Bounded object sets are about storage (files) not logical structures
(elements). In general, any hyperlink that addresses a logical construct
within a different storage object implies a storage-object-to-storage-object
dependency between the storage object containing the link and the storage
object containing the target of the link. For example, a cross reference
within a DITA topic to an element within another DITA topic within a different
XML document implies a dependency of the document containing the xref on 
the document containing the element that is the target of the xref.
<p>
Because DITA's map mechanism is specifically about defining collections
of resources via sets of links, it follows that all DITA bounded object sets
are determined either by literal maps or, having been established in some
non-map-based way, can be expressed as maps.
<p>The DITA BOS API includes a more generic bounded object set API that provides
the general model for a set of resources where each resource may have children
and may have non-child dependencies (representing arbitrary links from one
resource to another). A BOS member may have an associated URI, representing
the literal resource the BOS member represents. Each BOS member has a unique
key within the BOS, typically (but not necessarily), its fully-qualified
URI. The BOS member key is explicitly abstract so that implementations can
use other keys, such as repository object IDs or whatever.</p>
<p>The DITA-specific BOS objects add knowledge of the specific DITA resource
types of map and topic as well as a DITA bounded object set that always
has a root map member.</p>
<p>BOS processing is modeled generally using the Visitor pattern, which is
implemented to do various things with the BOS once constructed, such
as determining new URIs for BOS members as part of an import or export
operation, rewriting pointers within BOS member data to reflect movement or
reorganizing of the data for storage or interchange, or whatever.</p>
<p>The BOS model also includes a general BOS Reporter API for classes
that generate different types of reports for the BOS, such as reports
of BOS members or, in the case of DITA BOSes, key space reports.</p>
<p>In general, a bounded object set is exactly that: a set of objects, with
no necessary relationships among the members. In particular, any member of the
BOS may be dependent on any other members of the BOS. However, many data types, 
including DITA, have privledged parent-child relationships among resources,
so it is often useful to be able to view a BOS as a tree or as a set of trees
(more generally, any BOS member may be the root of a tree). This is certainly
the case for DITA where map-to-map topicrefs establish a tree of maps and,
more specifically, the rules for key space construction establish a strict
tree in which each map in the map tree occurs exactly once. The BOS API includes
methods for creating parent-child relationships among BOS members and accessing
the BOS as a tree rather than as a flat set of members.</p>
<p>Note that a DITA bounded object set does not reflect the <i>navigation</i>
hierarchy of the maps, only the map-to-map hierarchy. In addition, BOS members
represent <i>storage objects</i>, not topic elements. Thus, there may be a
significant difference between the logical structure of topics as represented
by the navigation hierarchy in a map and the storage-object-to-storage-object
relationships implicit in the links contained by maps and topics. In addition,
because there is no link-based mechanism for one topic to point to another
topic as a <i>child</i>, topic BOS members never have children, only
dependencies.</p>
