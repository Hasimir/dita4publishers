Provides sample and base implementations of the api.bos interface.
Provides base classes for BOS members.
<p>The class BosConstructionOptions manages DOM and Xerces grammar caches
that optimize document processing. The DOM and grammar caches can be made
available to other processes by using ThreadLocal variables. For example,
BOS construction could be the first stage in a pipeline that then re-uses
the already-constructed DOMs to do further processing.</p>
