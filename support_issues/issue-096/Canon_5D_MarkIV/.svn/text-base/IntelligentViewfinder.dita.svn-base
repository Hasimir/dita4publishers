<title>Intelligent Viewfinder</title>
<conbody>
<p>The optical viewfinder provides a 100% field of view with 0.71x
magnification and a wide viewing angle of 34.1%deg;. A refined design
integrates aspherical lens elements into the construction and lessens
distortions and color aberrations while providing greater clarity
for composing imagery. In addition to a clear view, a superimposed,
transparent LCD is also incorporated. This Intelligent Viewfinder
mode can be toggled on or off quickly at the touch of a button, allowing
you to remove all camera information for unobstructed viewing. The
information provided when it is on includes a customizable display
of focus points and grid lines, which can also be directed to appear
outside of the image area.</p>
<p> Canon's Dual Axis Electronic Level can also be used in conjunction
with the Intelligent Viewfinder and visually displays pitch and roll
angles, aiding in properly level horizons. When used in the viewfinder,
this feature can display +/- 6° of roll and +/- 4° of pitch in 1°
increments when held horizontally (the inverse is shown when held
vertically). The electronic level is particularly useful for landscape
photographers and those working with tilt and shift lenses whose angle
of view is especially critical.</p><?Pub Caret 0?>
