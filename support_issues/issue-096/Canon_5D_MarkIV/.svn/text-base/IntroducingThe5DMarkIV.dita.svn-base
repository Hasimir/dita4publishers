<title>Introducing The 5D Mark IV</title>
<conbody>
<p>The <b>Canon EOS 5D Mark IV Digital Camera (Body Only)</b> is a
full-frame 22.3MP DSLR featuring exceptional still image and movie
recording capabilities. Integrating Canon's new DIGIC 5+ Image Processor
and 14-bit A/D conversion, this camera is able to produce superbly
detailed imagery with immense low-light sensitivity that is further
aided by an extended ISO range up to 102400. Image quality is further
enhanced by the new 61-point high density reticular autofocus, including
up to 41 cross-type AF points and 5 dual diagonal AF points for ensured
sharpness. iFCL metering works in conjunction with the AF system and
uses color information from scenes to produce accurate exposure readings
using a 63 zone dual-layer metering sensor. HDR and Multiple Exposure
modes provide greater creative opportunities and help you to reduce
the amount of post-production time needed to produce high quality
imagery. The 5D Mark III is also capable of recording full HD video
with manual exposure control and in multiple frame rates, including
1080/30p and 720/60p. Still images can also be recorded up to 6fps. </p>
<p> Image review is possible using the 1,040,000-dot 3.2" Clear View
II LCD monitor, which features a high-transparency, reflection resistant
multi-coating for adequate viewing under bright conditions. The Intelligent
Viewfinder also integrates a superimposed LCD providing you with exposure
information and features a 100% field of view.  </p>
<p>A highly durable magnesium-alloy body surrounds the components
and offers increased dust and weather resistance. An updated EOS Integrated
Cleaning system also helps to reduce and remove dust within the camera
body. Several of the physical controls on the camera body are fully
customizable for a more efficient workflow and more convenient handling
scheme. Dual CF and SD memory card support also increases the compatibility
of the camera. Support is also provided for the optional Canon Wireless
File Transmitter and GPS receiver for remote logging, tracking, and
sending of your imagery.</p>
