<body>
Provides sample and base implementations of the api.ditabos interface.
Implements DITA BOS construction for DITA maps, including construction
of key spaces.
<p>The class BosConstructionOptions manages DOM and Xerces grammar caches
that optimize document processing. The DOM and grammar caches can be made
available to other processes by using ThreadLocal variables. For example,
BOS construction could be the first stage in a pipeline that then re-uses
the already-constructed DOMs to do further processing.</p>
