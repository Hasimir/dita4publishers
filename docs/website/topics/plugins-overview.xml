  <title>DITA For Publishers Open Toolkit Plugins</title>
  <body>
    <p>The DITA For Publishers project includes a number of DITA Open Toolkit plugins that make the
      Publishing document types available to the Toolkit (and to any tools that use the Toolkit to
      access DITA-based DTDs and schemas).</p>
    <p>Rather than providing one monolithic plugin, the plugins are organized into different plugins
      that contain different components. This allows you to use the DTD declarations without also
      getting the HTML extensions, for example.</p>
    <p>The plugins are named using a Java-style package naming convention, where the base part of
      the plugin name is the Internet domain for the project ("org.dita4publishers"),
      followed by one or more components that indicate the purpose of the plugin. The ".doctypes"
      plugin contains all the DITA for Publishers specialization declarations. For specific map
      types, topic types, or domains, there may be processing-specific plugins, e.g.,
      "org.dita4publishers.pubmap.html" provides HTML generation extensions and
      overrides for the pubmap map type.</p>
    <p>The DITA For Publishers project includes a Toolkit plugin for producing ePub-format electronic books.</p>
