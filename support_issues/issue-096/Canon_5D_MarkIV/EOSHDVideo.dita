recording</draft-comment>
<p>While recording video, a 4GB automatic file partition is employed
in order to gain longer continuous recording times, up to 29 minutes
59 seconds.<fn>Video recording requires SD cards with a speed rating
of 6 or more. A speed rating of 10 is recommended.</fn>Both All i-frame
and IPB compressions are supported as well as the standard H.264/MPEG
-4 AVC codec. Embedding the time code is also possible for greater
convenience when recording with multiple cameras. </p>
<p>Video performance is further enhanced with the ability to manually
adjust your exposure settings and audio levels while recording<fn
>The 5D Mark IV does not provide continuous auto-focus. You must focus
manually. A tripod and focus accessories such as follow-focus apparatus
are recommended.</fn>. By employing Live View, you can view your recording
on the LCD and make settings changes with a dedicated menu tab on
the fly. The DIGIC 5+ processor also dramatically improves video response
times and helps to reduce color artifacts, aberrations, and moir√©.
