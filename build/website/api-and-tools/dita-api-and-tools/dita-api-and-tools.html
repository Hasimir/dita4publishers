The DITA link management API provides a set of facilities for working with and managing     links within DITA documents, in particular keys and key references. The API is intended to be     useful and usable by a variety of different tools types: editors, content management systems,     processors, and so on. The API enables answers to two basic questions: "what resource is a given     key bound to?" and "Where is a given potential link target used within a given set of DITA     documents?".</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><strong><a href="../dita-api-and-tools/d4p-tools.html">DITA For Publishers Tools</a></strong><br/>
The DITA for Publishers tools provide implementations of the DITA Link Management API     as well as utilities for using the implementations and doing useful things, such as getting key     space reports and packaging DITA bounded object sets as Zip files (DITA Interchange Packages     (DXP) packages).</li>
