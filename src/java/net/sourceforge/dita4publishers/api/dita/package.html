Defines APIs for general DITA services and objects. The main 
interfaces are the DitaLinkManagementService and DitaKeySpace, which
provide facilities for working with DITA links and key-based addresses.
Key space construction depends on the DITA bounded object set
facilities in the .api.ditabos package.
