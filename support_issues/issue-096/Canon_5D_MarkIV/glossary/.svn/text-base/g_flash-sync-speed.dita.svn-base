<glossterm>flash sync speed</glossterm>
<glossdef>Exposure time with a focal-plane shutter is measured from
the instant the first curtain is released, to begin its travel across
the frame, until the instant the second curtain is released, to begin
its travel across the frame. When the first curtain reaches the end
of its travel, the frame is uncovered as far as the first curtain
is concerned, so it closes the electrical contacts for X sync and
fires the flash instantly. Shutter speed at which the entire frame
is exposed when the flash is fired in flash shooting. </glossdef>
