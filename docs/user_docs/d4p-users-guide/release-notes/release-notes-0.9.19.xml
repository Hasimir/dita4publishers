      <title>Theme for the Release</title>
      <p>The 0.9.19 release is primarily about finishing out and generalizing
        the map-based processing used in the EPUB, Kindle, HTML2, and HTML5
        transforms.</p>
      <p>I am also trying to get the vocabulary documentation finished out for
        this release.</p>
      <p>It is also about HTML5 with the new HTML5 transformation type,
        developed by Bertrand Lefort.</p>
      <p>The release also includes additions and refinements to the vocabulary,
        numerous bug fixes and whatnot.</p>
      <p>See the Sourceforge project files area for release notes of the various
        release candidates.</p>
