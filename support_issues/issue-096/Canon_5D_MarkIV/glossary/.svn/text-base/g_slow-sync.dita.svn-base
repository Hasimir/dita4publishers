<glossterm>slow sync</glossterm>
<glossdef>A flash technique for using the flash at a slow shutter
speed. Flash shooting in dim light or at night at a fast shutter speed
often results in a flash-illuminated subject against a dark background.
Using a slower shutter speed with the flash brings out the background
details in the picture. Use of a slow shutter speed with Rear-Curtain
Sync is particularly effective for illustrating the movement of a
stream of light. Can be of very creative if put to good use.</glossdef><?Pub
