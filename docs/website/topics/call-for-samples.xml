  <title>Call for Sample Publications (Free Data Conversion)</title>
  <body>
    <p>Eliot Kimber says: </p>
    <p>For Publishing document samples, my general offer is:</p>
    <p>If you, the Publisher, will provide:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Electronic source and final form of one or more Publishing documents</li>
      <li>An appropriate non-copyright license, such as a <xref
          href="http://creativecommons.org/"
          format="html"
          scope="external">Creative Commons</xref> non-commercial license, for those documents as
        served by the DITA For Publishers project through the project's Web site  (so that the DITA
        For Publishing project can make the source and rendered forms freely available for at least
        non-commercial use).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I will provide:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Conversion of the content to DITA-based XML using the Publishing For DITA markup as
        appropriate.</li>
      <li>The resulting XML back to you, the Publisher, with your original copyright retained, for
        you to do with as you will.</li>
      <li>Such renditions as I can produce with the tools at hand (e.g., HTML, EPub, PDF using
        XSL-FO).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In the unlikely event I get inundated with samples, I retain the right to cry "uncle". </p>
    <p>Note that this is an offer of <i>free data conversion</i> at the small cost of providing a
      non-exclusive, non-commercial-use license for the content. The value to the DITA For
      Publishing project is the chance to develop both a larger body of illustrative examples and
      practical experience with representing Publishing documents.</p>
