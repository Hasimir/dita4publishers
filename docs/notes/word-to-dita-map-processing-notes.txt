When generating maps and topics from a single set of incoming paragraphs
there are two separate level hierarchies:

1. The hierarchy of paragraphs that generate maps and topicrefs

2. The hierarchy of paragraphs that generate nested topics

A given paragraph may generate any of the following:

- Root map 
- Root map and map title
- Root map and map title, topic doc, and topicref to the topic
- Submap and reference to the submap
- Submap and map title and reference to the submap
- Submap and map title, reference to the submap, topic doc, and topicref to the topic
- Topic group
- Topic head
- Topic doc and topicref to the topic
- Nested topic (topic within another topic with no topicref to it in the map)

For example:

Title: level = 0: Generates root map and title
Heading 1: Level 1: Generates topichead
Heading 2: Level 2: Generates submap and topic doc
Heading 3: Level 3: Generates topic doc and topicref to topic
Heading 4: Level 4: Generates subtopic

For any topicref-generating paragraph should be possible to specify @containerType to 
produce containing topicgroup element.

In addition, need way to generate key definitions.
