  <title>Sample Publications</title>
  <body>
    <p>The DITA For Publishers project includes a number of sample publications that test and
      demonstrate the DITA For Publishers specializations and supporting processors. These samples
      are mostly public-domain publications adapted from <xref
        href="http://www.gutenberg.org"
        format="html"
        scope="external">Project Gutenberg</xref>, as well as an DITA-based reworking of Jon Bosak's
      XML Shakespear dada set. In addition, the DITA For Publishers project has an open call for
      contributions of sample publications (see TBD).</p>
    <p>In the source tree, all the samples are in the directory <xref
        href="http://dita4publishers.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/dita4publishers/trunk/sample_data/"
        format="html"
        scope="external">trunk/sample_data/</xref>, organized into unspecialized publications and
      specializations, where the specializations include any specialization modules, supporting
      Toolkit plugins, and so on. The general organization is that each publication is organized
      into its own directory where the directory name is the same as the publication's root DITA
      map. This organization allows for general production scripts to simply take the publication
      name and work out the map name, output file names, and so on, from that. </p>
