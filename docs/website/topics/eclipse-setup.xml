  <title>Setting Up Eclipse to Run Toolkit Ant Tasks</title>
  <taskbody>
    <context>
      <p>The DITA For Publisher materials are optimized for development using the <xref
          href="http://www.eclipse.org"
          format="html"
          scope="external">Eclipse</xref> development environment. In order to run DITA Open Toolkit
        against DITA For Publishers materials from Eclipse, you must modify Eclipse's Ant
        configuration to include the Toolkit-specific JAR files. The DITA For Publishers <filepath
          >build.xml</filepath> file includes a property that points to your local Toolkit
        installation. You need to also set that property to reflect your local installation. These
        instructions assume that you already have Eclipse installed and running. The DITA For
        Publishers source code includes an Eclipse <filepath>.project</filepath> file.</p>

    <steps>
      <step>
        <cmd>Open the Eclipse Preferences dialog.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Navigate to Ant/Runtime and select the "Classpath" tab.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Select the "Global Entries" item in the Classpath pane and then select "Add External
          JARs...".</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Navigate to your Toolkit's <filepath>lib/</filepath> directory and select all the
            <filepath>.jar</filepath> files.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>If you have a Toolkit that includes Saxon (which you should), repeat Step 4 and select
          all the jars in <filepath>lib/saxon</filepath>.</cmd>
      </step>
    </steps>
    <result>
      <p>You should now be able to run the project's Toolkit-using targets, e.g. "epub-wizard-of-oz"
        from within Eclipse.</p>
