<prereq>HDR is enabled only when shooting JPEGs. RAW shooting is not
supported.</prereq>
<context>HDR stands for high dynamic range. When you shoot HDR, the
camera does automatic exposure bracketing, taking 3, 5, or 7 shots,
one correctly exposed, one or more over-exposed, and one or more under-exposed.
The number of stops by which the image is under- and over-exposed
is configurable. The camera then combines the images into a single
image, preserving detail in both the highlights and shadows. The results
can be breathtaking.</context>

and over-expose.</cmd></step>
