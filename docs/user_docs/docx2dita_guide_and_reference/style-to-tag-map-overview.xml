  <title>Style to Tag Mapping</title>
  <shortdesc>The docx2dita transform is driven by a configuration file, the style-to-tag map. The
    style-to-tag map enables an entirely or almost-entirely configuration-driven transformation of
    styled Word documents into DITA-based XML, specialized or not. Through careful design of Word
    templates it is possible to quickly configure the transformation to produce good XML
    documents.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>The style-to-tag map consists of a sequence of <xmlelem>style</xmlelem> elements, where each
      style element defines the mapping for a paragraph, character, list, or table style to the
      appropriate DITA XML structure. The mapping document may also include an initial <xmlelem
        >documentation</xmlelem> element that can hold documentation in any markup language (its
      content is ignored and not validated), as well as <xmlelem>output</xmlelem> elements that
      define the public and system IDs to use for any generated map or topic documents.</p>
    <p>The basic rules and constraints for the mapping are:<ul>
        <li>The result document always consists of a single root topic or map. The first non-skipped
          and non-root-topic-prolog paragraph in the Word document must be of structure type
          "topicTitle", "map", or "mapTitle" and level "0" (zero).</li>
        <li>Paragraph styles that map to topic titles and contained elements (within topic bodies)
          must map to exactly one fixed level. Thus, to have two levels of subsection topics, you
          must have two separate paragraph styles, one that maps to level 1 and one that maps to
          level 2, even though both map to <xmlelem>subsection</xmlelem> topic types.</li>
        <li>Character style mapping is flat within a paragraph: there is currently no general way to
          infer multiple levels of inline markup from a flat sequence of character runs (this is
          more a limitation of Word's character styles than of the mapping mechanism). In theory it
          would be possible to use marker characters or character styles or, more reliably, embedded
          XML elements, to capture more complex inline structures.</li>
        <li>Each mapped style effectively says "I'm this type of structure, I go in this part of the
          topic, and (if necessary), I'm contained by this containing element." That, plus other
          details as needed for specific types of target elements, is sufficient to enable accurate
          creation of DITA XML from appropriately-styled Word documents.</li>
        <li>Common containment is determined by adjacency of similar container types and levels. For
          example, within a topic body, each sequence of adjacent paragraphs with the same <xmlatt
            >containerType</xmlatt> and <xmlatt>level</xmlatt> value will be grouped together within
          the same result element as determined by the <xmlatt>containerType</xmlatt> value.</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>Each style mapping has the following required attributes:<dl>
      <dlentry>
        <dt><xmlatt>styleName</xmlatt></dt>
        <dd>The Word style name. This is the value in the <xmlatt>w:val</xmlatt> attribute of the <xmlelem>w:style</xmlelem>/<xmlelem>w:name</xmlelem> element whose <xmlatt>w:styleId</xmlatt> value matches the style ID specified by a given paragraph, text run, list item, or table. This is the display name of the style as shown in the various style-related dialogs in Word. The style name is not case sensitive, so "Heading 1" and "heading 1" identify the same style. Note that styles may have associated aliases. Mapping to aliases is not supported as of version 0.9.16.<p>If you specify <xmlatt>styleName</xmlatt> you should not specify <xmlatt>styleId</xmlatt>. If you specify both then <xmlatt>styleName</xmlatt> is used.</p></dd>
      </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt><xmlatt>styleId</xmlatt></dt>
          <dd>The Word style ID. This is the value in the <xmlatt>w:val</xmlatt> attribute of the <xmlelem>w:*Style</xmlelem> element associated with given paragraph, text run, list item, or table. Note that this value is not the same as the display name of the style. For example, spaces and underscores in style names are removed to form the style ID. In general, you can construct the style ID for a given style by simply removing all spaces from the style's display name.<p>If you specify <xmlatt>styleId</xmlatt> you should not specify <xmlatt>styleName</xmlatt>. If both are specified, <xmlatt>styleName</xmlatt> is used.</p></dd>

        <dlentry>
          <dt><xmlatt>structureType</xmlatt></dt>

                <dd>Paragraphs that start new topics and provide their titles. The style mapping

                  same level 1 container, interrupted by a skipped paragraph, and followed by more
                  paragraphs in the same level 1 container will be in a single container instance in

            is no reliable way to map a flat list of paragraphs into a hierarchy of XML elements).
            For structure type "topicTitle", level "0" indicates the root topic for the result

            distinct from the level hierarchy for paragraphs that contribute to topic bodies
            (topicZone="body"). For body paragraphs, the level is relative to the body itself. E.g.,
            level="1" would be for first-level list items, level="2" for second-level list items,

            section-generating paragraph can also provide the section title text for use in a
              <xmlelem>title</xmlelem> element or the section title can be provided by the paragraph
            following the section-generating paragraph. The possible values for <xmlatt

                  the value of the text up to but not including the colon. The text following the

            content should be used ("elementsOnly"), or only the text content, with all text runs
            included by any mappings ignored ("textOnly"). The "textOnly" value is intended for use
            in generating attribute values, e.g., values for the <xmlatt>value</xmlatt> attribute of
              <xmlelem>data</xmlelem> elements. When the value is "elementsOnly", only text runs
            with character styles will be used in the result XML. All other content will be ignored.
            This is useful for extracting metadata fields from text content where the text itself is
            not needed in the XML (because it will be generated at rendition time, for
            example).</dd>

            in the correct location, especially in topic prologs where elements can only occur in a
            specific place in the sequence of prolog elements. The value is as for the DITA <xmlatt

            recognized are a function of the specific docx2dita transformation used. In general,
            values should be the most general DITA-defined classes, but extensions to the base
            transform may expect or recognize more specialized values. Only needs to be specified
            for elements that must occur in a specific place within a given topic zone in the result
