  <title>How To Use the DITA For Publishers Materials</title>
  <body>
    <p>You can use the DITA For Publishers materials in the following ways:<ul>
        <li>Use the Toolkit plugins to process publication maps (or other maps)</li>
        <li>Use the sample data as examples of how to represent different types of publications
          using the Publishing specializations</li>
        <li>Use the specialization modules as the base for your own Publishing-related
          specializations.</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>As provided, the plugins and documents can be used immediately with the DITA Open Toolkit.
      They should work with the 1.4.3 version of the Toolkit, but are intended to be used with the
      1.5 version (which supports DITA 1.2 features).</p>
    <p>You should be able to use the materials with any DITA-aware XML editor that uses the Open
      Toolkit to resolve DTD references, such as OxygenXML. All the materials have been developed
      and tested using OxygenXML primarily, but they not have any Oxygen-specific aspects or data
      (nor anything specific to any other editor).</p>
    <p>Note that currently there are only DTD versions of the specializations, so tools that require
      XSD schemas will not be able to use them right now.</p>
