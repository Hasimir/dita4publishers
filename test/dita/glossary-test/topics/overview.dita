  <title>Glossary Test</title>
  <body>
    <p>This document is a test of glossary processing.</p>
    <p>The main map includes a submap that defines a set of keydefs, one for each glossary entry.</p>
    <p>The main map also includes a <codeph>&lt;glossarylist></codeph> element, which should trigger generation of the glossary.</p>
    <p>Here is a reference to the glossary entry for "cherry" (term element is within the square brackets): [<term
      keyref="gloss-cherry-food"/>].</p>
    <p>Here is a reference to the glossary entry for "blackberry" (term element is within the square brackets): [<term
      keyref="gloss-blackberry-food"/>].</p>
