<glossterm>bracketing</glossterm>
<glossdef>Taking a series of photographs of the same subject at different
exposures to insure the "correct" exposure; useful when shooting in
situations where a normal metering reading is difficult to obtain.
Taking additional pictures of the subject through a range of exposures-both
lighter and darker-when unsure of the correct exposure. The 5D Mark
IV has automatic bracketing, while manually you can bracket by the
use of, say, adjusting apertures or shuttle speeds setting or both,
manually adjusting ISO setting, or even adjusting the flash output
power etc.</glossdef><?Pub Caret 527?>
