  <title>Lists</title>
  <body>
    <p>This topics contains samples of all the different kinds of base lists (ol, ul, sl, dl) in
      various combinations. One challenge with rendering lists in DITA is that list items are not
      required to contain paragraph elements, so a list item may consist of just PCDATA or PCDATA
      followed by paragraphs or other paragraph-level elements or may have only paragraphs.</p>

      <title>Single-Level Lists</title>
      <p>Simple list (cannot contain paragraph-level elements within sli):</p>
      <sl>
        <sli>Simple list item 1. PCData only</sli>
        <sli>Simple list item 2. PCData only</sli>
        <sli>Simple list item 3. PCData only</sli>
      </sl>
      <p>Unordered list without nested paras:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unordered list item 1 PCDATA only.</li>
        <li>Unordered list item 2 PCDATA only.<p>Second paragraph of unordered list item with no
            initial paragraph. So, unless this reef was subject to the intermittent eruptions of a
            geyser, the Governor Higginson had fair and honest dealings with some aquatic mammal,
            until then unknown, that could spurt from its blowholes waterspouts mixed with air and
            steam.</p></li>
        <li>Unordered list item 3 PCDATA only.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Unordered list with nested paras:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Unordered list item 1, nested para.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Unordered list item 2, nested para.</p>
          <p>Second paragraph of unordered list item with initial paragraph. Similar events were
            likewise observed in Pacific seas, on July 23 of the same year, by the Christopher
            Columbus from the West India &amp; Pacific Steam Navigation Co.</p>

      <p>Ordered list without nested paras:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Ordered list item 1 PCDATA only.</li>
        <li>Ordered list item 2 PCDATA only.<p>Second paragraph of ordered list item with no initial
            paragraph. Consequently, this extraordinary cetacean could transfer itself from one
            locality to another with startling swiftness, since within an interval of just three
            days, the Governor Higginson and the Christopher Columbus had observed it at two
            positions on the charts separated by a distance of more than 700 nautical leagues.</p></li>
        <li>Ordered list item 3 PCDATA only.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Ordered list with nested paras:</p>
      <ol>

          <p>Ordered list item 1, nested para</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Ordered list item 2, nested para</p>
          <p>Second paragraph of ordered list item with initial paragraph. Fifteen days later and
            2,000 leagues farther, the Helvetia from the Compagnie Nationale and the Shannon from
            the Royal Mail line, running on opposite tacks in that part of the Atlantic lying
            between the United States and Europe, respectively signaled each other that the monster
            had been sighted in latitude 42° 15' north and longitude 60° 35' west of the meridian of
            Greenwich.</p>
