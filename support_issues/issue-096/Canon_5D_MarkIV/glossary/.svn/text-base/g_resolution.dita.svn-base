<glossdef>The ability of a lens to discern small detail; in photography,
the image resolution in the final photograph depends on the resolving
power of the sensor and on that of the lens. The two are not related,
but the effective resolution is a function of both; for reasonably
accurate photographic measurements of lens resolution, the sensitive
material must therefore have a much greater resolving power than the
lens.</glossdef><?Pub Caret 412?>
