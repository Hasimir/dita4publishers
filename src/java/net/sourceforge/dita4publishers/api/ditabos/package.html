<p>Extends the base BOS model to accommodate DITA-specific bounded object
sets. Adds types and methods that reflect the abstract DITA data model 
(maps, topics, etc.).
</p>
<p>
Because DITA's map mechanism is specifically about defining collections
of resources via sets of links, it follows that all DITA bounded object sets
are determined either by literal maps or, having been established in some
non-map-based way, can be expressed as maps.</p>
<p>The DITA-specific BOS objects add knowledge of the specific DITA resource
types of map and topic as well as a DITA bounded object set that always
has a root map member.</p>
<p>Note that a DITA bounded object set does not reflect the <i>navigation</i>
hierarchy of the maps, only the map-to-map hierarchy. In addition, BOS members
represent <i>storage objects</i>, not topic elements. Thus, there may be a
significant difference between the logical structure of topics as represented
by the navigation hierarchy in a map and the storage-object-to-storage-object
relationships implicit in the links contained by maps and topics. In addition,
because there is no link-based mechanism for one topic to point to another
topic as a <i>child</i>, topic BOS members never have children, only
dependencies.</p>
<p>The DITA-specific dependency types reflect the different types of link
relationship DITA defines: link, xref, topicref, image, object, navref, etc.
These dependency types serve to characterize individual dependencies and allow
grouping, sorting, and filtering by dependency type using the BOS alone.
Note that at the BOS level, dependencies don't reflect every link instance, 
only the fact that two BOS members have a dependency of a certain type.
For example, a topic that has both a conref and an xref to another topic
in a different document establishes a single "is dependent on" relationship
but two distinct dependency types (conref and xref). That is, for the 
purposes of determining the BOS it is sufficient to know that there is *at least one*
dependency of one member on another member, since that is all that is needed
to include the dependency in the BOS, but it might also be useful to know *why*, in a 
general way, one member is dependent on another. Note that managing knowledge
of all the links between two dependent members is the job of a link management
service, not the job of the BOS constructor. Thus while BOS construction operates
on the link, the resulting BOS, by itself, does not maintain knowledge of all
the links.
