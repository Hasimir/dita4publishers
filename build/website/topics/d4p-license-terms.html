    <p class="p">All DITA for Publishers materials are licensed with the same Apache license as used by the DITA Open Toolkit or with a compatible but less restrictive license. Sample materials are either in the public domain or are licensed with some form of Creative Commons license.</p>

    <p class="p">The general intent for the DITA for Publishers projects is that all the materials may be used as the base for commercial or non-commercial derivative works as long as an apppropriate attribution is included in any use.</p>

    <div class="p">In particular, the following uses are explicitly allowed:<ul class="ul" id="topic-id__ul_15128c74-7eb2-4b1e-8c78-5974526603f4">
      <li class="li">The DITA for Publishers Open Toolkit plugins may be bundled with third-party tools and commercial products, either separately or as part of a larger Open Toolkit package.</li>

      <li class="li">The non-Toolkit materials may be used in commercial and non-commerical products as allowed by the Apache license (which allows essentially unrestricted use with attribution).</li>

      <li class="li">The sample materials may be used without restriction except where they carry a restrictive license as required by the original source.</li>
