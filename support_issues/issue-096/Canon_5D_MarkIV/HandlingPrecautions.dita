<title>Handling Precautions</title>
<conbody>
<section><title>Camera Care</title><note type="warning">This camera
is a precision instrument. Do not drop it or subject it to physical
shock.</note><ul>
<li><p> The camera is not waterproof and cannot be used underwater.
If you accidentally drop the camera into water, promptly consult your
nearest Canon Service Center. Wipe off any water droplets with a dry
cloth. If the camera has been exposed to salty air, wipe it with a
well-wrung wet cloth. </p></li><?Pub Caret -2?>
<li><p>Never leave the camera near anything having a strong magnetic
field such as a magnet or electric motor. Also avoid using or leaving
the camera near anything emitting strong radio waves such as a large
antenna. Strong magnetic fields can cause camera misoperation or destroy
image data. </p></li>
<li><p>Do not leave the camera in excessive heat such as in a car
in direct sunlight. High temperatures can cause the camera to malfunction. </p
></li>
<li><p>The camera contains precision electronic circuitry. Never attempt
to disassemble the camera yourself. </p></li>
<li><p>Do not block the mirror operation with your finger, etc. Doing
so may cause a malfunction. </p></li>
<li><p>Use a blower to blow away dust on the lens, viewfinder, reflex
mirror, and focusing screen. Do not use cleaners that contain organic
solvents to clean the camera body or lens. For stubborn dirt, take
the camera to the nearest Canon Service Center. </p></li>
<li><p>Do not touch the camera’s electrical contacts with your fingers.
This is to prevent the contacts from corroding. Corroded contacts
can cause camera misoperation. </p></li>
<li><p>If the camera is suddenly brought in from the cold into a warm
room, condensation may form on the camera and internal parts. To prevent
condensation, first put the camera in a sealed plastic bag and let
it adjust to the warmer temperature before taking it out of the bag. </p
></li>
<li><p>If condensation forms on the camera, do not use the camera.
This is to avoid damaging the camera. If there is condensation, remove
the lens, card and battery from the camera, and wait until the condensation
has evaporated before using the camera. </p></li>
<li><p>If the camera will not be used for an extended period, remove
the battery and store the camera in a cool, dry, well-ventilated location.
Even while the camera is in storage, press the shutter button a few
times once in a while to check that the camera is still working. </p
></li>
<li><p>Avoid storing the camera where there are corrosive chemicals
such as a darkroom or chemical lab. If the camera has not been used
for an extended period, test all its functions before using it. </p
></li>
<li><p>If you have not used the camera for some time or if there is
an important shoot coming up, have the camera checked by your Canon
dealer or check the camera yourself and make sure it is working properly.</p

<section><title>LCD Panel and LCD Monitor</title><ul>
<li><p>Although the LCD monitor is manufactured with very high precision
technology with over 99.99% effective pixels, there may be a few dead
pixels among the remaining 0.01% or less pixels. Dead pixels displaying
only black or red, etc., are not a malfunction. They do not affect
the images recorded.</p></li>
<li><p>If the LCD monitor is left on for a prolonged period, screen
burn-in may occur where you see remnants of what was displayed. However,
this is only temporary and will disappear when the camera is left
unused for a few days.</p></li>
<li><p>In low or high temperatures, the LCD monitor display may seem
slow or it may look black. It will return to normal at room temperature.</p
></li>
</ul></section>
<section><title>Cards</title><p>To protect the card and its recorded
data, note the following:</p><ul>
<li><p>Do not drop, bend, or wet the card. Do not subject it to excessive
force,physical shock, or vibration. </p></li>
<li><p>Do not touch the card’s electronic contacts with your fingers
or anything metallic. </p></li>
<li><p>Do not store or use the card near anything having a strong
magnetic field such as a TV set, speakers, or magnet. Also avoid places
prone to having static electricity. </p></li>
<li><p>Do not leave the card in direct sunlight or near a heat source. </p
></li>
<li><p>Store the card in a case. </p></li>
<li><p>Do not store the card in hot, dusty, or humid locations.</p
></li>
</ul></section>
<section><title>Lens</title><p>After detaching the lens from the camera,
attach the lens caps and put down the lens with the rear end up to
avoid scratching the lens surface and electrical contacts.</p></section>
