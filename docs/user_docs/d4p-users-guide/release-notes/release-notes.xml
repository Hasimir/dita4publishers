    <p>The DITA for Publishers materials consists of the following major components. Each component has its own version number. The package of materials as a whole also has a version number, which is incremented for each release. For example, the vocabulary modules may be updated without the need to update any of the Toolkit plugins. In that case, the package and vocabulary version numbers are incremented but the Toolkit version numbers are not. All of the D4P Toolkit plugins report their individual version numbers when then run.</p>
    <p>The components are:<ul>
      <li>The DITA for Publishers vocabulary modules, packaged as the Open Toolkit plugin org.dita4publishers.doctypes.</li>
      <li>The Open Toolkit plugins for EPUB, Kindle, and HTML generation (the "HTML2" plugin).</li>
      <li>The Word-to-DITA transformation framework and Toolkit plugin</li>
      <li>The DITA-to-InDesign transformation framework and Toolkit plugin</li>
      </ul></p>
    <p>The package also contains renditions of the <cite>DITA for Publishers User Guide</cite>.</p>
    <p>The source materials for the DITA for Publishers project are available via anonymous Subversion access (including Web-based Subversion access) from <xref
      href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dita4publishers"
      format="html"
