<glossterm>chromatic aberration</glossterm>
<glossdef>A lens aberration producing an overall blurred image; the
inability of a lens to bring all wavelengths of light (especially
red and blue) into the same plane of focus; usually present in regular
large-aperture telephoto and super-telephoto lenses; does not improve
by stopping down the lens; correctable through the use of low Dispersion
(ED, LD SD) glass. Basically, this aberration is caused by light rays
of different wavelengths coming to focus at different distances from
the lens. Blue will focus at the shortest distance and red at the
greatest distance. Since the natural rays of light are a mixture of
colors, each aberration will give a different value corresponding
to each color thus producing blurred images.</glossdef><?Pub Caret 485?>
