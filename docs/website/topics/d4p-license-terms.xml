  <title>DITA for Publishers Licensing Terms</title>
  <shortdesc>The DITA for Publishers project is an open source project whose intent is to foster the widest possible use and adoption of DITA. To that end its licensing terms are as unrestrictive as possible and appropriate.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>All DITA for Publishers materials are licensed with the same Apache license as used by the DITA Open Toolkit or with a compatible but less restrictive license. Sample materials are either in the public domain or are licensed with some form of Creative Commons license.</p>
    <p>The general intent for the DITA for Publishers projects is that all the materials may be used as the base for commercial or non-commercial derivative works as long as an apppropriate attribution is included in any use.</p>
    <p>In particular, the following uses are explicitly allowed:<ul
      id="ul_15128c74-7eb2-4b1e-8c78-5974526603f4">
      <li>The DITA for Publishers Open Toolkit plugins may be bundled with third-party tools and commercial products, either separately or as part of a larger Open Toolkit package.</li>
      <li>The non-Toolkit materials may be used in commercial and non-commerical products as allowed by the Apache license (which allows essentially unrestricted use with attribution).</li>
      <li>The sample materials may be used without restriction except where they carry a restrictive license as required by the original source.</li>
      </ul></p>
