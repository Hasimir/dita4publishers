<p>The sensor is also features a high S/N ratio and larger individual
pixels for increased visual depth and cleaner looking images. A new
photodiode structure and increased photoelectric conversion rate also
helps to improve the overall sensitivity of the sensor, resulting
in a reduction in image noise and improved high ISO performance.</p>
