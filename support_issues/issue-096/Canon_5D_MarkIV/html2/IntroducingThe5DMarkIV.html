<div class="body conbody">
<p class="p">The <strong class="ph b">Canon EOS 5D Mark IV Digital Camera (Body Only)</strong> is a
full-frame 22.3MP DSLR featuring exceptional still image and movie
recording capabilities. Integrating Canon's new DIGIC 5+ Image Processor
and 14-bit A/D conversion, this camera is able to produce superbly
detailed imagery with immense low-light sensitivity that is further
aided by an extended ISO range up to 102400. Image quality is further
enhanced by the new 61-point high density reticular autofocus, including
up to 41 cross-type AF points and 5 dual diagonal AF points for ensured
sharpness. iFCL metering works in conjunction with the AF system and
uses color information from scenes to produce accurate exposure readings
using a 63 zone dual-layer metering sensor. HDR and Multiple Exposure
modes provide greater creative opportunities and help you to reduce
the amount of post-production time needed to produce high quality
imagery. The 5D Mark III is also capable of recording full HD video
with manual exposure control and in multiple frame rates, including
1080/30p and 720/60p. Still images can also be recorded up to 6fps. </p>

<p class="p"> Image review is possible using the 1,040,000-dot 3.2" Clear View
II LCD monitor, which features a high-transparency, reflection resistant
multi-coating for adequate viewing under bright conditions. The Intelligent
Viewfinder also integrates a superimposed LCD providing you with exposure
information and features a 100% field of view.  </p>

<p class="p">A highly durable magnesium-alloy body surrounds the components
and offers increased dust and weather resistance. An updated EOS Integrated
Cleaning system also helps to reduce and remove dust within the camera
body. Several of the physical controls on the camera body are fully
customizable for a more efficient workflow and more convenient handling
scheme. Dual CF and SD memory card support also increases the compatibility
of the camera. Support is also provided for the optional Canon Wireless
File Transmitter and GPS receiver for remote logging, tracking, and
sending of your imagery.</p>

<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">A newly designed 22.3MP full-frame CMOS sensor is incorporated
into the 5D Mark III providing you with highly detailed, rich images
with a maximum resolution of 5616 x 3744 pixels.</p>

<p class="p">The sensor is also features a high S/N ratio and larger individual
pixels for increased visual depth and cleaner looking images. A new
photodiode structure and increased photoelectric conversion rate also
helps to improve the overall sensitivity of the sensor, resulting
in a reduction in image noise and improved high ISO performance.</p>

<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Processing speed and power are increased to promote significantly
greater overall performance and response from all aspects of the camera.</p>

<p class="p">New algorithms are incorporated in order to promote better noise
reduction for higher ISOs and chromatic aberration compensation. The
increase in processing speed also helps to improve the continuous
shooting rate, bringing it to 6 full-resolution frames-per-second.</p>

<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The newly designed 61-point autofocus interface helps to
ensure critical focus no matter how complex or difficult the situation
is.</p>

<p class="p">Featuring up to 41 cross-type AF points (with f/4 lens support)
and 5 dual diagonal AF points (with f/2.8 sensitivity); this AF system
is highly accurate and extremely low-light sensitive.  The dedicated
AF menu tab permits quick and easy access, eliminating the need to
navigate through settings menus in order to modify your AF settings.
Autofocus point selection is broken up into 6 different methods-Spot,
Single Point, Single + 4 Adjacent Points, Single + 8 Adjacent Points,
Zone Selection, and Automatic AF Point Selection-as well as a dedicated
AF configuration tool for control of AI Servo AF III tracking parameters.</p>

adjust your exposure settings and audio levels while recording<a name="fnsrc_2" href="#fntarg_2"><sup>2</sup></a>. By employing Live View, you can view your recording
on the LCD and make settings changes with a dedicated menu tab on
the fly. The DIGIC 5+ processor also dramatically improves video response
times and helps to reduce color artifacts, aberrations, and moiré.

<h2 class="title topictitle2">iFCL 63-Zone Dual Layer Metering Sensor</h2>

<div class="body conbody">
<p class="p">An intelligent metering system works in conjunction with the autofocus
system and independently analyzes 'Focus, Color, and Luminance' within
the scene for the most precise exposure settings possible. The 63
zones cover the entire image area with great detail and the dual-layer
design permits a wider sensitivity to different wavelengths of light.</p>

<p class="p"> The dual layers are split into a red/green channel and a blue/green
channel; which counters the red light sensitivity bias electronic
sensors inherently have. A series of algorithms are employed to combine
data received from both layers, with the resulting exposure reading
being extremely accurate regardless of the shooting conditions.</p>

<div class="topic concept nested1" xml:lang="en" lang="en" id="IntelligentViewfinder-9CAA1641">
<h2 class="title topictitle2">Intelligent Viewfinder</h2>

<div class="body conbody">
<p class="p">The optical viewfinder provides a 100% field of view with 0.71x
magnification and a wide viewing angle of 34.1%deg;. A refined design
integrates aspherical lens elements into the construction and lessens
distortions and color aberrations while providing greater clarity
for composing imagery. In addition to a clear view, a superimposed,
transparent LCD is also incorporated. This Intelligent Viewfinder
mode can be toggled on or off quickly at the touch of a button, allowing
you to remove all camera information for unobstructed viewing. The
information provided when it is on includes a customizable display
of focus points and grid lines, which can also be directed to appear
outside of the image area.</p>

<p class="p"> Canon's Dual Axis Electronic Level can also be used in conjunction
with the Intelligent Viewfinder and visually displays pitch and roll
angles, aiding in properly level horizons. When used in the viewfinder,
this feature can display +/- 6° of roll and +/- 4° of pitch in 1°
increments when held horizontally (the inverse is shown when held
vertically). The electronic level is particularly useful for landscape
photographers and those working with tilt and shift lenses whose angle
of view is especially critical.</p>
