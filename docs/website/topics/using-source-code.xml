  <title>Using the DITA For Publishers Source</title>
  <taskbody>
    <context>
      <p>You can also use the DITA For Publishers materials directly from the project's source code
        control system. You can also use the materials as a model for local development setups for
        developing your own DITA specializations. The materials are managed using Subversion through
        SourceForge. You can use any Subversion client to access the source code, such as
        TortoisSVN, the Oxygen Subversion client, or the Subclipse plugin for Eclipse.</p>
    </context>
    <steps>
      <step>
        <cmd>Using a Subversion client, check out a read-only copy of the
          materials, following the instructions on the project's code access
          page: <xref
          format="html"
          href="https://sourceforge.net/p/dita4publishers/code"
          scope="external">https://sourceforge.net/p/dita4publishers/code</xref></cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Create a file named <filepath>build.properties</filepath> or <filepath
            >.build.properties</filepath>, either in the project's directory or in your home
          directory.</cmd>
        <info>
          <p>This file is used by the project's Ant build script to configure the location of the
            DITA Open Toolkit.</p>
        </info>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Edit the <filepath>build.properties</filepath> file you just created and add the
          property "dita-ot-dir".</cmd>
        <stepresult>
          <p>The property specification should look like
            this:<codeblock>dita-ot-dir=<i>{path-to-toolkit}</i></codeblock></p>
          <p>Where "<i>{path-to-toolkit}</i> is wherever directory contains your Toolkit, e.g.
            "c:/dita-ot" or "/Applications/Oxygen/frameworks/dita/DITA-OT" or whatever.</p>
          <p>If you use Oxygen or similar tool that provides a Toolkit and maintain multiple
            versions of the tool, it can be useful to define a separate property for the editor
            location,
            e.g.:<codeblock>oxygen_home=/Applications/oxygen_10.2
dita-ot-dir=${oxygen_home}/frameworks/dita/DITA-OT</codeblock></p>
        </stepresult>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Save the file.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Test the DITA for Publishers' Ant file by running the target
          "deploy-toolkit-plugins".</cmd>
        <info>
          <p>From a command line where the dita4publishers directory is the current directory, run
            this command (assuming Ant in your PATH):</p>
          <codeblock>ant deploy-toolkit-plugins</codeblock>
          <p>You should see messages indicating that the plugins have been copied to your toolkit
            and the integrate task has been run.</p>
        </info>
      </step>
    </steps>
    <result>
      <p>You should now be ready to use the Publishing specializations with the Toolkit and edit
        documents that use them using any XML editor that uses your Toolkit to get the DTDs its
        needs (e.g., OxygenXML).</p>
      <p>Other editors may require more work to configure to enable editing.</p>
