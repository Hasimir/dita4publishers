<h2>DITA for Publishers DITA API and Tools Package</h2>
<p>This package provides a set of APIs for DITA link
management as well as sample implementations of the
APIs and some simple tools that use the APIs.</p>
<p>The focus of the package is on the construction
of DITA "bounded object sets": the set of storage
objects ultimately required in order to process
a given set of maps and topics completely.</p>
<p>One of the main link management challenges with
DITA 1.2 is constructing and use key spaces. The
DITA link management API provides a general key space
construction and resolution API, packaged in a
more general DITA Link Management Service API.</p>
<p>The implementation provided includes a general
DITA BOS constructor, which is then used to build
key spaces managed by a simple DITA Link Management
Service implementation.</p>
<p>The tools provided include:
<ul>
<li>A map BOS reporter, which generates BOS and key
space reports for DITA maps.</li>
<li>A DITA Interchange Package (ditadxp.sourceforge.net)
builder, which constructs Zip packages of all the local
dependencies required by a given root map.</li>
</ul>
<p>The API is intended to be a public API that could be
used by different types of DITA-aware tools: editors,
processors, content management systems, etc.</p>
<p>The implementations provide both tests of the APIs
and code that can be the base for new processors.</p>
<p>The API and all implementations in this package are
licensed with the same Apache open source license as
the DITA Open Toolkit.</p>
<p>See the descriptions for each package for more details
on the API and implementations.</p>
