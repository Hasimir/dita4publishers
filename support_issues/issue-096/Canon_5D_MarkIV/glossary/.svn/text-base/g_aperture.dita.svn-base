<glossdef>Lens opening. The hole or opening formed by the metal leaf
diaphragm inside the lens or the opening in a camera lens through
which light passes to expose the film. The size of aperture is either
fixed or adjustable. Aperture size is usually calibrated in f- numbers-the
larger the number, the smaller the lens opening. Aperture affects
depth of field, the smaller the aperture, the greater is the zone
of sharpness, the bigger the aperture, the zone of sharpness is reduced.
The hole or opening formed by the metal leaf diaphragm inside the
lens; controls amount of light and depth of field, prevents vignetting
and reduces lens aberrations; the size of the aperture is indicated
by its f-number, i.e., the ratio of the diameter of the opening to
the focal length of the lens; a large aperture is indicated by a small
numerical f-number.</glossdef>
