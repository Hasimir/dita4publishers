<p>Featuring up to 41 cross-type AF points (with f/4 lens support)
and 5 dual diagonal AF points (with f/2.8 sensitivity); this AF system
is highly accurate and extremely low-light sensitive.  The dedicated
AF menu tab permits quick and easy access, eliminating the need to
navigate through settings menus in order to modify your AF settings.
Autofocus point selection is broken up into 6 different methods-Spot,
Single Point, Single + 4 Adjacent Points, Single + 8 Adjacent Points,
Zone Selection, and Automatic AF Point Selection-as well as a dedicated
AF configuration tool for control of AI Servo AF III tracking parameters.</p>
