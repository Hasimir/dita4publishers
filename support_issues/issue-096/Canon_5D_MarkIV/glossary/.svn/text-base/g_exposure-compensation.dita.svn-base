<glossdef>Exposure compensation for available light is activated by
changing the shutter speed and/or lens aperture. This is done by using
AE L AF-L (Auto Exposure/Autofocus Lock) button or exposure compensation
button, or by Auto Exposure Bracketing . In flash photography with
a dedicated E-TTL Speedlite exposure compensation can also be performed
by varying the amount of flash output. Camera-originated exposure
compensation affects both the foreground subject and the background;
variations in flash output amount affect only the foreground.</glossdef>
