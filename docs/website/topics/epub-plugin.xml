  <title>EPub Plugin</title>
  <body>
    <p>The EPub plugin (net.sourceforge.dita4publishers.epub) generates electronic books in <xref
        href="http://www.openebook.org/"
        format="html"
        scope="external">IDPF</xref> epub format. These ebooks can be read by most eBook readers,
      including <xref
        href="http://www.adobe.com/products/digitaleditions/"
        format="html"
        scope="external">Adobe Digital Editions</xref>, <xref
        href="http://www.lexcycle.com/"
        format="html"
        scope="external">Stanza</xref>, and others.</p>
    <p>The content of the EPub is HTML as generated by the normal Toolkit HTML generation process,
      which means that any HTML extensions integrated with your Toolkit will also be used to
      generate the EPub content.</p>
    <p>The EPub plugin supports generic maps, book maps, and publication maps.</p>
    <p>If you install the full set of DITA For Publishers Toolkit plugin then you get the EPub
      plugin automatically.</p>
    <p>You can also download and install the EPub plugin separately from the DITA For Publishers
      download area. Simply unzip the dita4publishers_epub.zip file into the plugins or demo
      directory of your local Open Toolkit installation and run the integrator Ant build file as
      explained here: <xref

      <title>Known Issues</title>
      <p>As of 21 May 2009, there are the following known issues:<ul>
          <li>The Zip file is created from the files in the output directory. If the output
            directory is not cleared before processing different maps the resulting EPub package may
            include topics or graphics from a previously-processed map.</li>
        </ul></p>
