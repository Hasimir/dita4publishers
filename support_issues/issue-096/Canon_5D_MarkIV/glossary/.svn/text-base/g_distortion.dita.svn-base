<glossdef>Even if the other possible aberrations were totally eliminated,
images could result that still have a distorted appearance. For an
example, an rectangle may appear as a barrel or pin cushion-shaped
object. A lens aberration which does not affect the sharpness of the
image, but alters the shape of objects; the inability of a lens to
render straight lines perfectly straight; does not improve by stopping
down the lens; there are two types of distortion:<ul>
<li><p>Barrel: Straight lines are bowed in at the edges of the picture
frame resembling the sides of a barrel; present in small amounts in
some wide angle or wide angle zoom lenses, but uncorrected in fisheye
lenses.</p></li>
<li><p>Pincushion: The opposite of barrel distortion; straight lines
are bowed in toward the middle to resemble the sides of a pincushion;
present in smal amounts in some telephoto and telephoto-zoom lenses</p
