  <h1 class="topictitle1">Paragraph-Level Elements</h1>

  <div><p>This topic contains samples of all paragraph-level elements except lists, which have
      their own topic.</p>
<p>First paragraph within a topic. The relevant data on this apparition,
      as recorded in various logbooks, agreed pretty closely as to the structure of the object or
      creature in question, its unprecedented speed of movement, its startling locomotive power, and
      the unique vitality with which it seemed to be gifted. If it was a cetacean, it exceeded in
      bulk any whale previously classified by science. No naturalist, neither Cuvier nor Lac&eacute;p&egrave;de,
      neither Professor Dumeril nor Professor de Quatrefages, would have accepted the existence of
      such a monster sight unseen&#8212;specifically, unseen by their own scientific eyes. </p>
<p>A second
      paragraph. Striking an average of observations taken at different times&#8212;rejecting those timid
      estimates that gave the object a length of 200 feet, and ignoring those exaggerated views that
      saw it as a mile wide and three long&#8212;you could still assert that this phenomenal creature
      greatly exceeded the dimensions of anything then known to ichthyologists, if it existed at
      all. </p>
<p>A short
      paragraph.</p>

      <p>A paragraph within an example. Now then, it did exist, this was an undeniable fact; and
        since the human mind dotes on objects of wonder, you can understand the worldwide excitement
        caused by this unearthly apparition. As for relegating it to the realm of fiction, that
        charge had to be dropped. </p>

        reef; he was even about to fix its exact position when two waterspouts shot out of this
        inexplicable object and sprang hissing into the air some 150 feet.</p>
