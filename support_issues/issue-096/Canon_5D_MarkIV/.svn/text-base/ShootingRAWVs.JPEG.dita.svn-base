<title>Shooting RAW vs. JPEG</title>
<shortdesc>Shooting in RAW format enables you to produce better results
if you post-process your images. Shooting in JPEG produces small files
and requires no post-processing.</shortdesc>

<p>Shooting in RAW format has several advantages, the most important
of which is no loss of image data when the file is stored, and the
ability to adjust many aspects of the photo in post-processing without
losing quality. For example, you can use Adobe Camera Raw or Adobe
Photoshop Lightroom to adjust the white balance of a shot after the
fact. RAW files are not compressed and are therefore not lossy. One
disadvantage of shooting in RAW is larger file sizes, which means
you can fit fewer images on your card.</p>
<p>Shooting in JPEG requires no post-processing. The image is processed
in the camera, and attributes such as sharpness, contrast, and saturation
are applied before saving the image to the card. Some cameras enable
you to adjust how these attributes are applied by creating <term>profiles</term
>.</p>
<p>JPEG is a compressed and therefore lossy format. However, you can
control the amount of compression with camera settings. These settings
in your 5D Mark IV are called Quality. <xref format="dita"
